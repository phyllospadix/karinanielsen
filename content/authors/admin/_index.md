bio: 
# Marine ecologist with a passion for coastal ecosystems. My research projects have focused on the ecology, biodiversity, oceanography, and biogeochemistry of rocky shores and beaches from the wave-swept outer coast to brackish estuaries. Key themes of interest are climate change, including ocean/coastal acidification, hypoxia, global/ocean warming, and sea level rise; coastal conservation and stewardship; biodiversity; envirnmental justice; climate adaptation; environmentenvironmental policy; diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and access; data visualization; science engagement; inclusive pedagogy; STEAM education.

I am a marine ecologist with a life-long passion for ecosystems at the edge of the sea (or the edge of the land depending on your perspective). The places where people, nature, and water come together. I lead the Oregon Sea Grant College Program, a collaboration between NOAA and Oregon State University in service to Oregon's coastal ecosystems and communities. I used lead a university marine laboratory and field station on San Francisco Bay. My research projects have focused on the ecology, oceanography, and biogeochemistry of the coastal fringe and nearshore waters, from the wild and wave-swept outer coast to urban estuaries. Themes I am especially interested in include climate change and its impacts (especially, coastal acidification, hypoxia, marine heat waves, sea level rise); blue carbon; stewardship, conservation, and restoration; policy; climate adaptation. My teaching experience includes courses on marine biology and ecology, invertebrate biology, marine plants and algae, biological oceanography, data visualization and analysis, science writing, and science communication.
