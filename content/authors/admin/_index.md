bio: Marine ecologist with a passion for coastal ecosystems. My research projects focus on the ecology, biodiversity, oceanography, and biogeochemistry of rocky shores and beaches from the wave-swept outer coast to estuaries. Themes include the impacts of climate change, including ocean/coastal acidification, global warming, and sea level rise; conservation; policy; climate adaptation.

I am a professor of biology and executive director of the Estuary & Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University. I do research to understand how coastal ecosystems work and how they respond to climate change. I am also interested in transdisciplinary themes at the intersection of people, science, and nature: environmental policies and justice, inclusive pedagogy, and public science engagement. My university teaching includes courses on marine biology and ecology, invertebrates, marine plants and algae, biological oceanography, data visualization and analysis, science communication, scientific writing, and professional skills.  

A bit more about my journey: I grew up in New York City. I was lucky to spend most summers at the seashore or near lakes, cultivating a love of swimming, body surfing, fishing, and generally exploring coastal aquatic biodiversity. My career track was not direct. There were three major detours en route to my undergraduate degree in biology: 1) studying fine art photography (including the physics and art of holography); 2) learning to cook for a small and very popular restaurant in NYC; and 3) giving birth to my son. I returned to college to complete my undergraduate degree because I became interested in a career in science journalism, specifically to help communicate about large scale environmental problems so we could solve them. In hindsight it's clear I had bought into the science deficit model! Along the way, I fell in love with science and was seduced by the wonders of marine life. I had no idea what a scientist did for a living, but some of my undergraduate professors strongly encouraged me to consider going graduate school and becoming a professor. I took a big leap of faith, and with the privilege of much needed support from my extended family during the inevitable financial pitfalls along the way, I managed to do just that.
