bio: Marine ecologist with a passion for coastal ecosystems. My research projects focus on the ecology, biodiversity, oceanography, and biogeochemistry of rocky shores and beaches from the wave-swept outer coast to estuaries. Themes include the impacts of climate change, including ocean/coastal acidification, global warming, and sea level rise; conservation; policy; climate adaptation.

I am a professor of biology and executive director of the Estuary & Ocean Science Center at San Francisco State University. I do research to understand how coastal ecosystems work and respond to climate change. I am interested in transdisciplinary themes at the intersection of people, science, and nature: policy, environmental justice, inclusive pedagogy, and science engagement. My university teaching has included courses on marine biology and ecology, invertebrates, marine plants and algae, biological oceanography, data visualization and analysis, science communication, scientific writing, and professional skills.  

*A bit more about my journey:* I grew up in New York City. I was lucky to spend summer vacation at the seashore or near lakes, cultivating a love of swimming, body surfing, fishing, and generally exploring coastal aquatic biodiversity. My career track was not direct. There were three major detours en route to my undergraduate degree in biology: 1) studying fine art photography (including the physics and art of holography); 2) cooking for a small and very popular restaurant in NYC (learned on the job); and 3) giving birth to my son before I finished college. I returned to complete my undergraduate degree because I became interested in a career in science journalism, specifically to help communicate about large scale environmental problems so we could solve them. In hindsight, it's clear I had bought into the science deficit model! Along the way, I fell in love with science and was seduced by the wonders of marine life and oceanography. Some of my undergraduate professors strongly encouraged me to go to graduate school and become a scientist. I actually had no idea what a scientist, or what it meant to be a graduate student. The thought of writing a PhD was completely foreign and intimidating to me, but I decided to take on the challenge. With a giant leap of faith, the enormous privilege of knowing my extended family would provide a financial safety net (needed on many occasions), some wonderful mentors, hard work, student loans, and a dash of good luck, I managed to achieve my professional goals.
